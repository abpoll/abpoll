I'm currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Earth, Environment, and Sustainability at the University of Iowa. My research on flood risk management is motivated by, and responsive to, the concerns and values of affected parties and decision-makers. I pursue research questions that can offer actionable insights for public policy and decision-focused academic research practices. This often calls for collaborative and interdisciplinary research, which I greatly enjoy.
