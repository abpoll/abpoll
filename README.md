I'm currently a Research Scientist in the [Keller Lab Group](https://keller-lab.github.io/) in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. My research on natural disaster risk management is motivated by, and responsive to, the concerns and values of affected parties and decision-makers. I pursue research questions that can offer actionable insights for public policy and decision-focused academic research practices, particularly in U.S. flood risk management. This often calls for collaborative and interdisciplinary research, which I greatly enjoy.
